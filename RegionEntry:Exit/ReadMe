There are 3 stages of the pipeline that we build-
1) Detection
2) Tracking
3) Counting

There are 3 folders with the same name containing the codes for corresponding stage.

1) Detection-
The "object_detection.py" file when run on all the videos produces a file for each video containing all the vehicle detections for that video.

2) Tracking-
The "object_detection_video_tensorflow.py" file when run for all the detection files and corresponding ROIs produces a file for each video containing list of trajectories detected in that video.

3) Counting-
For counting, the first step is Graph Modelling. We run the "graph_modelling.cpp" for all the detection files and it produces 2 files for each file-
  a Node File -> contains the details of all the nodes formed for that video
  a Vehicle File -> contain the details of all the vehicles observed and their entry and exit node.
  
Finally we run "Graph Result Reader.py" on node file and video file of each video. 
At an intermediate step it generates all the images of node of entry and exit pair observed.
Then those images are manually labelled for a MoI.
After which the remaining code is run.

Note that, while labelling certain manipulations on frame of exit where made and hence the exact same result may not be produced.
